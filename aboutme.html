    About Me:
My name is Nikki and I have my PhD in clinical psychology. I earned my degree from an R1 university in the summer of 2023 and have an active research program in clinical affective neuroscience/fMRI. I am currently working as a post-doc and putting together an NIH grant. I have 10 publications (5 first author) in reputable journals & have not completely lost my sanity or love of science yet! I call that a win.
I love teaching R and I love mentoring in all regards. These are aspects of academia that have brought me consistent joy. I have taught many undergraduate and graduate students one-on-one, in small groups, and in full classrooms as well as in-person and virtually. I have experience teaching trainees in psychology techincal skills in R, MATLAB, fMRI software (AFNI, SPM etc.) as well as broader research skills like reading articles, academic/research writing, study design, presenting, and much more.
I've received extensive training in psychotherapy, primarily in CBT and mindfulness-based interventions. So we can chat about that (this is not however an invite to message about your personal mental health).
I am also a human. I have two cattos, love board games, and want to hike more.
