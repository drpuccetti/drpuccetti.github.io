<h1>About Me:</h1>
<div>
<p>My name is Nikki and I have my PhD in clinical psychology. I earned my degree from an R1 university in
the summer of 2023 and have an active research program in clinical affective neuroscience/fMRI. I am currently
working as a post-doc and putting together an NIH grant. I have 10 publications (5 first author) in reputable
journals & have not completely lost my sanity or love of science yet! I call that a win.
</p>

<p>
I love teaching R and I love mentoring in all regards. These are aspects of academia that have brought me
consistent joy. I have taught many undergraduate and graduate students one-on-one, in small groups, and in
full classrooms as well as in-person and virtually. I have experience teaching trainees in psychology
techincal skills in R, MATLAB, fMRI software (AFNI, SPM etc.) as well as broader research skills like reading
articles, academic/research writing, study design, presenting, and much more.
</p>

<p>
I've received extensive training in psychotherapy, primarily in CBT and mindfulness-based interventions.
So we can chat about that (this is not however an invite to message about your personal mental health).
</p>

<p>
I am also a human. I have two cattos, love board games, and want to hike more.
