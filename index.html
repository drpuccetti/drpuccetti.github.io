<h2>
Here are a few general details about what I'd like to offer.
</h2>
<div>
<h3>
This is using R/R Studio as an example, but as you'll see below,
there are definitely other topics we can cover.
</h3>

<ul>

<li>
First, brief 30m Intro: We can meet each other, hear about your goals, 
hear about any experience you have, you can feel out if you like me enough to work with me, 
and we can set a rough plan for our work together etc.
</li>

<li>
Then, for those with little to no experience: I hope to start people who are new to R in
a very small group setting where we can go through the basics of R together and you can benefit
from hearing others' questions, ideas, and challenges
</li>

<li>
For those with some experience under their belt: Tailored, individual sessions covering the topics
you are most interested in! I can provide tutoring to supplement an existing learning structure/course
or teach you from the ground up. We can develop a specific project start to finish or explore different
applications. Really whatever your needs are in the data science space in psychology and related fields,
I can help.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>
    We can work on a wide range of topics:
</h2>
<h3>
    R (and MATLAB)
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Introductory programming and data types (vectors, data frames, etc.)</li>
    <li>Data wrangling and cleaning</li>
    <li>Basic plotting (with ggplot2)</li>
    <li>Complex visualization</li>
    <li>Statistical models</li>
    <li>a bunch of others things</li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Beyond this... I am more than happy to talk other areas of my expertise!    
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Conceptual and technical skills in fMRI data analysis.</li>
    <li>Conceptual and teachincal skills in statistics for psychological science.</li>
    <li>Writing feedback and editting for research manuscripts and/or application materials.</li>
    <li>General mentorship about clinical psychology, pursuing a PhD, building a research program etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Timing:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sessions Offered: 30m/60m/90m sessions; will almost certainly be over Zoom/Teams</li>
    <li>Frequency: Flexible to your needs (weekly, biweekly, as needed etc.)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Will mostly be scheduled weeknights and weekends (EST) but again, there is flexibility
        to meet your needs</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>
    Cost:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pay-What-You-Can/Sliding Scale: I aim to meet people where they are at. I totally get that
        cost can be really prohibitive and I am open to discussing and deciding together what will
        work for you. I really love teaching and mentoring and I do not want to put up more barriers
        to access than already exist. I do want to cover my time/effort on average across this whole endeavor
        though, so let's just talk!
    </li>    
</ul>

<h3>In the future, I would like to offer package discounts and incentives such as referral discount/program but these
are not currently in place </h3>
